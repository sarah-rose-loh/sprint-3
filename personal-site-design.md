 The primary purpose of my site is to provide content about my journey with web development, but to also showcase the skills I have learnt in the course.

 My target audience is those looking to get into web development and are wondering what it is like. Ultimately I would also like it to showcase some of my projects so the target would be potential employees/contacts.

 I would like my site visitors to be able to easily navigate between the different blog posts, projects and information about me. The content should be easily read and look accessible on the page. I would like everything to not be more than 2 clicks away. The less clicks the better.

 I will make my site responsive to different devices and the elements will change according to the likely needs of the device user. The website will have a sidebar so that the information is easy to access, but on the mobile site you may click in to the side bar information so that the main content is not pushed to the side. The content will have plenty of space around it, but if you want to quickly click to other information, this will be easily accessible at the sidebar.
